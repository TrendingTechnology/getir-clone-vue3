## :question: What is the Vue.js?
Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like **view**) is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It builds on top of standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and provides a declarative and component-based programming model that helps you efficiently develop user interfaces, be it simple or complex.

## :question: What is the Vite?

Vite (French word for "quick", pronounced  /vit/, like "veet") is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It consists of two major parts:

-   A dev server that provides  [rich feature enhancements](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html)  over  [native ES modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules), for example extremely fast  [Hot Module Replacement (HMR)](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#hot-module-replacement).
    
-   A build command that bundles your code with  [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/), pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.
    

Vite is opinionated and comes with sensible defaults out of the box, but is also highly extensible via its  [Plugin API](https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-plugin.html)  and  [JavaScript API](https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-javascript.html)  with full typing support.

## :question: What is the Tailwindcss?
Tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and any other templates for class names, generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file.

It's fast, flexible, and reliable — with zero-runtime.
